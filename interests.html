        <!-- <ul> Eliminated the <ul> and remained with paragraphs instead

            <h2>Photography and Whale Watching</h2>
            <p>I have always been fascinated with the ocean. For fun (and for credit) I remember attending Oceanography and Marine Biology courses in university. Growing up, I constantly read books about whales and dolphins, and eventually (in the late '80s), accomplished my childhood dream of becoming a (dolphin/whale) Trainer at <em>SeaWorld!</em></p>
            <p>I also enjoy photographing marine life and seascapes and publishing the photos on my websites. I am now an advocate for natural marine habitats.</p>

              <h2>Coding</h2> 
              <p> As far back as I can remember, I’ve always been fascinated with computers, tinkering with gadgets, and learning new technologies. As I became older I realized I wanted to have a career in software development. I enjoy focusing on the creative aspect that coding provides, and it's especially rewarding to provide meaningful work that is helpful to others.</p>

        <h2>Traveling</h2> 
        <p>As cliché as it sounds, I really DO love to travel! I am grateful that I have been in positions that have allowed me to experience many different cultures, languages, and parts of the world.</p>

        <h2>Swimming</h2> 
            <p> I spent most of my early life swimming competitively. I don't swim competitively anymore, but I still enjoy swimming laps from time to time to stay in shape. Early on as a swimmer, I learned to be self-disciplined, to believe in myself and support my team, and to be a better person.</p>
