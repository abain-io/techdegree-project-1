            <h2>Photography and Whale Watching</h2>
            <p>I have always been fascinated with the ocean. In addition to business and computer science courses, I especially enjoyed taking Oceanography and Marine Biology courses in university. Growing up, I constantly read books about whales and dolphins, and eventually (in the late '80s), accomplished my childhood dream of becoming a (dolphin) Trainer at <strong>SeaWorld.</strong></p>
            <p>I also enjoy photographing marine life and seascapes and publishing some of the photos on my websites. I am now an advocate for natural marine habitats.</p>

              <h2>Coding</h2> 
              <p> As far back as I can remember, Iâ€™ve always been fascinated with computers, tinkering with gadgets, and learning new technologies. As I became older I realized I wanted to have a career in web design and development.</p> 
                
                <p>I enjoy the creative aspect that web design and coding provides, and it's especially rewarding to provide meaningful work that is helpful to others.</p>

        <img src="images/WPlogo-waterSM.jpg" alt="WordPress icon" height="250" width="400" class="card-title">
        <p>Several years ago I was first drawn to web development after figuring out how to create a website using WordPress. I became inspired to continuously learn more. I like to attend local WordPress meetups, and the annual "WordCamp" in Seattle and Austin.</p>

        <h2>Traveling</h2> 
        <p>I love to travel, and am grateful that I have been able to experience different cultures and see many parts of the world.</p>

        <h2>Swimming</h2> 
            <p> I spent most of my early life swimming competitively. I don't swim competitively anymore, but I still enjoy swimming laps from time to time to stay in shape. Early on as a swimmer, I learned self-discipline, to believe in myself and my team, and be a better person.</p>
